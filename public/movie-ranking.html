<h1>The Best Movies According to Shaikot</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Three Idiotsâ€™ is a remarkable ahead of its time 
    Bollywood blockbuster. This film is a comedy movie 
    with strong acting, memorable characters, a 
    perplexing storyline and most importantly, 
    highly motivational 
    movie to choose the right path in your life.</p>

<h3>Attack on titan</h3>
<p>This show holds a special place in my heart as one of 
    my all-time favorites. While nostalgia may contribute 
    to my love for it, I genuinely believe that this 
    series is one of the most brilliantly crafted stories 
    of all time. The journey of the show, from its humble 
    beginnings to its breathtaking conclusion, explores 
    the depths of human instinct, strategy, and personal 
    growth in a truly magnificent way. Some may criticize 
    the stark contrast between the initial setting and the 
    final stages of the story, but I believe that this 
    stark contrast is what makes Attack on Titan truly 
    beautiful. Evolution. The symbolism and hidden meanings 
    that unfold throughout the narrative are a 
    testament to the meticulous storytelling.</p>

<h3>Vinland Saga</h3>
<p>delivers beautifully written story with mind-blowing 
    charecter designs and development, accompanied by best 
    choreographed action sequences. My favourite part of 
    the series is the story boarding it manages to have 
    through everything and the spice of accurate history 
    to make the show more enjoyable and relatable at times 
    with respect to real life. To my opinion Vinland Saga 
    is one in a million type shows, which not only manages 
    to leave behind almost all the new gen shonen animes, 
    but also many tv shows at this point. Right now as i 
    am reviewing the show, it's season 2 is airing with 
    new episodes every Monday and all of them have been 
    magnificent. Totally a must watch show with a 
    banging 5/5 rating from my side.</p>
